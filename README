A* Algorithm Simulation by Eric Hepperle

Description:
  This A* Algorithm simulator is a lightweight JavaFX application designed to demonstrate
  basic understanding of pathfinding algorithms in a 2-Dimensional environment. The program's 
  UI includes a grid 'map' representing the environment, as well as buttons allowing 
  the user to change the environment. The algorithm requires a starting position and a goal
  position and is initiated with the 'find path' button. It will analyze the map and highlight 
  the shortest path, as well all of the other paths considered.

Project Includes:
Main.java, GridButton.java, ConfirmBox.java, AlertBox.java

Installation/Usage:
1. Ensure your system has JDK 8 or newer to provide the JavaFX libraries.
2. Either create a JAR file, or open the files as a project in a Java compatible IDE
3. Using command line to make jar file:
  a. Open command line in directory of .java files
  b. Create a directory for project build
  c. javac -d ./build *.java
  d. Move to the build directory
  e. jar cvf YourJar.jar *
4. Using an IDE:
  a. Create new Java project
  b. Add .java files to new project
  c. compile and run
