Description:
  This A* Algorithm simulator is a lightweight JavaFX application designed to demonstrate
  basic understanding of pathfinding algorithms in a 2-Dimensional environment. The
  Application's UI includes buttons to set up a grid 'map' representing the environment, as well as buttons allowing 
  the user to change the environment. The algorithm demonstration requires a starting position and a goal
  position(determined by the user) and is initiated with the 'find path' button. It will analyze the map and highlight 
  the shortest path, as well all of the other paths considered.

Project Package Includes:
Main.java, GridButton.java, ConfirmBox.java, AlertBox.java

Installation/Usage:
1. Ensure your system has JDK 8 or newer to provide the proper JavaFX libraries.
2. Either (3)create a JAR file, or (4)open and build the files as a project in a Java compatible IDE
3. Using command line to create a jar file:
  a. Open command line in directory of .java files
  b. Create a directory for project build
  c. javac -d ./build *.java
  d. Move to the build directory
  e. jar cvf YourJar.jar *
4. Using an IDE to open and build:
  a. Create new Java project
  b. Add .java files to new project
  c. compile and run
